## Assessment

**The database has real content** from actual use:
- ✅ 7 concepts with full content
- ✅ 1 complete capsule with anchor and repurposed content
- ⚠️ No links between concepts (opportunity to create relationships)

This appears to be a working knowledge base with legitimate content, not just test data. The system has been used to:
1. Create and manage concepts
2. Create a capsule following Jana Osofsky's strategy
3. Generate repurposed content from an anchor post

The lack of links suggests the user may want to:
- Use the AI link proposal feature to discover relationships
- Manually create links between related concepts
- Build out the knowledge graph
