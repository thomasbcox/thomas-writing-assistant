linkProposer:
  systemPrompt: "You are analyzing relationships between concepts in a knowledge graph. Propose meaningful, typed links."
  # User prompt template - use {{variable}} for placeholders
  # Available variables: sourceTitle, sourceDescription, sourceContentPreview, candidateList, linkNames, maxProposals
  userPromptTemplate: |
    Analyze the relationship between this concept and the candidate concepts below.

    SOURCE CONCEPT:
    Title: {{sourceTitle}}
    Description: {{sourceDescription}}
    Content Preview: {{sourceContentPreview}}

    CANDIDATE CONCEPTS:
    {{candidateList}}

    AVAILABLE LINK NAMES: {{linkNames}}

    For each candidate concept, determine:
    1. If there's a meaningful relationship (confidence 0.0-1.0)
    2. The most appropriate link name from the available list
    3. A brief reasoning

    Return a JSON object with a "proposals" array:
    {
      "proposals": [
        {
          "target_id": "concept-id",
          "forward_name": "link name",
          "confidence": 0.85,
          "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
        }
      ]
    }

    Only include proposals with confidence >= 0.5. Limit to {{maxProposals}} proposals.

conceptProposer:
  systemPrompt: "You are analyzing text to extract distinct, standalone concepts. Each concept should be a complete idea that can stand alone."
  # Available variables: textToAnalyze, instructions, maxCandidates
  userPromptTemplate: |
    Analyze the following text and extract {{maxCandidates}} distinct core concepts.

    Each concept should be:
    - A complete, standalone idea (typically 1-2 pages worth of content)
    - Clearly distinct from other concepts
    - Have a clear title and summary
    - Include the full content text

    TEXT TO ANALYZE:
    {{textToAnalyze}}
    {{instructions}}

    Return a JSON object with a "concepts" array:
    {
      "concepts": [
        {
          "title": "Concept Title",
          "description": "Short description for search",
          "summary": "Brief summary",
          "content": "Full content text (extracted from the source text, preserving original formatting)"
        }
      ]
    }

    Extract the content directly from the source text when possible. Only generate content if the source text doesn't contain enough detail.
