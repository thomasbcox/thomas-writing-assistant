# Documentation Date Standards

When adding or updating dates in any documentation file:

1. ALWAYS run `date +"%B %d, %Y"` to get the actual current date from the OS
2. NEVER guess, assume, or use relative dates
3. ALWAYS use the OS date output exactly as returned
4. Format: "December 20, 2025" (full month name, day, year)

This applies to:
- PROJECT_HISTORY.md entries
- Documentation "Last Updated" dates
- Any date references in markdown files

Example workflow:
1. Run: `date +"%B %d, %Y"`
2. Use the exact output in documentation
3. Verify no date assumptions were made
